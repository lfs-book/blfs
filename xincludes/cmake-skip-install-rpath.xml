    <para>
      <parameter>-DCMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH=ON</parameter>: This switch
      makes <command>cmake</command> remove hardcoded library search paths
      (rpath) when installing a binary executable file or a shared library.
      This package does not need rpath once it's installed into the standard
      location, and rpath may sometimes cause unwanted effects or even
      security issues.
